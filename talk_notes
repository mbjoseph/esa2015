First part:

include citation
use lines instead of dots
Keep investment in defense rather than competence

OR
Frog example

Mention that these quantities are hard to measure

In subsection for 1st section, have theory header

## Competition

Think about dual effect of competition as regulator of diversity and mediator of the effect of diversity
- potentially bring in some of Joe's work

### Modes of transmission

Simpler figure - illustrating difference between FD and DD transmission
- how this relates to divergent predictions

FD and DD: define, introduce the parameters

Add a specific plot showing that the intermediate forms fit much better than straight DD and FD

Among parasite competition: field data

Put unimodal slide after Conclusions

Theory vs. data AND my work vs. other work

## Why symbionts in general include microbiome as parenthetical

## Temporal scale
- instantaneous vs. integrated quantities

## Conclusions

More declarative conclusions

## Slide 1 as problem statement diversity disease scale and symbionts
- highlight controversy and interest
- then outline slide

## Be clear about how I'm proceeding
This is the kind of talk I'm going to give

Potentially use example of similar situation in history
- be clear that it's a synthetic talk that's linked by common theme
